# SWE262 Milestones

### Build Instructions 

*Build the class files from the package root directory src/main/java*
```shell
javac org/json/*.java
```

*Create the jar file in the current directory*
```shell
jar cf json-java.jar org/json/*.class
```

*Compile a test program that uses the jar (from the package root directory src/test/java)*
```shell
javac -cp .;../../main/java/json-java.jar org/json/M2Test.java (Windows)
javac -cp .:../../main/java/json-java.jar org/json/M2Test.java (Unix Systems)
```

*Execute the file*
```shell 
java -cp .;../../main/java/json-java.jar org/json/M2Test (Windows)
java -cp .:../../main/java/json-java.jar org/json/M2Test (Unix Systems)
```

### Running the Unit Tests

*navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and execute the test suite with Maven:*
```shell
mvn clean test
```

# Milestone 2 

### New Functions
File Path: `src/main/java/org/json/XML.java`

```shell 
static JSONObject toJSONObject(Reader reader, JSONPointer path)
```
- **Purpose**: Read an XML file into a JSON object, and extract some smaller sub-object inside. Useful for efficiently parsing large XML files to extract targeted data without processing the entire document.
- **Line Number**: Starts at line 937.


```shell 
static JSONObject toJSONObject(Reader reader, JSONPointer path, JSONObject replacement)
```
- **Purpose**: 
Modifies a segment of an XML document by replacing it on a certain key path with a new JSONObject. This method is ideal for updating XML data and converting it directly to JSON.
- **Line Number**: Starts at line 989.


```shell 
static boolean parseMile2(XMLTokener x, JSONObject context, String name, XMLParserConfiguration config, String specialKey, JSONObject specialData, boolean isReplaceMode)
```
- **Purpose**: A helper method used internally to navigate and parse XML content, facilitating the conversion and modification processes outlined above. It handles specific tasks like searching for elements, handling replacements, and building the JSONObject.
- **Line Number**: Starts at line 1034.


### New Unit Test

File Path: `src/test/java/org/json/junit/XMLTest.java`
Line Number: Starts at line 1331.

#### Test Scenarios
- **testToJSONObjectWithValidPath()**: Test for Valid Path Conversion
- **testToJSONObjectWithInvalidPath()**: Test for Invalid Path
- **testToJSONObjectWithInvalidPath()**: Test for Successful Replacement 
- **testToJSONObjectWithReplacement()**: Test for Replacement Path Not Found

# Milestone 3

### New Functions
File Path: `src/main/java/org/json/XML.java`

```shell 
public static JSONObject toJSONObject(Reader reader, Function keyTransformer)
```
- **Purpose**: Converts XML content read from a Reader into a JSONObject. It applies a transformation to every key encountered during the parsing process, according to the logic defined in the keyTransformer function.
- **Line Number**: Starts at line 1240.


```shell 
private static boolean parseMile3(XMLTokener x, JSONObject context, String name, XMLParserConfiguration config,  Function keyTransformer)
```
- **Purpose**: 
A modified version of the existing parse method, which includes an additional parameter for the keyTransformer and applies it to keys during the parsing process.
- **Line Number**: Starts at line 1259.


#### Performance Implications
Applying key transformations inside the library during the parsing process, rather than after converting XML to JSON in client code, has significant performance implications:

- **Efficiency:** Transforming keys during parsing avoids the need for a second pass through the JSONObject to modify keys. This is more efficient, especially for large XML documents, as it reduces the overall computation and memory footprint.
- **Complexity:** Implementing key transformation logic within the library simplifies client code, reducing complexity and potential errors in client-side post-processing.
- **Performance Overhead:** While adding key transformation during parsing introduces additional checks and function calls for each key, this overhead is mitigated by eliminating the need for a costly second traversal of the resulting JSONObject.


### New Unit Test

File Path: `src/test/java/org/json/junit/XMLTest.java`
Line Number: Starts at line 1420.

#### Test Scenarios
- **testToJSONObjectKeyTransformerAddPrefix():** Tests the transformation of keys by adding a prefix to each key.
- **testToJSONObjectKeyTransformerReverse():** Verifies the functionality of reversing each key.
- **testToJSONObjectKeyTransformerUpperCase():** Ensures that keys are correctly transformed to uppercase.
Each test case validates not only the transformation of keys but also that the transformation does not alter the associated values in the JSONObject.

# Overview

[JSON](http://www.JSON.org/) is a light-weight language-independent data interchange format.

The JSON-Java package is a reference implementation that demonstrates how to parse JSON documents into Java objects and how to generate new JSON documents from the Java classes.

Project goals include:
* Reliable and consistent results
* Adherence to the JSON specification 
* Easy to build, use, and include in other projects
* No external dependencies
* Fast execution and low memory footprint
* Maintain backward compatibility
* Designed and tested to use on Java versions 1.8 - 21


The files in this package implement JSON encoders and decoders. The package can also convert between JSON and XML, HTTP headers, Cookies, and CDL.

Bug fixes, code improvements, and unit test coverage changes are welcome! Because this project is currently in the maintenance phase, the kinds of changes that can be accepted are limited. For more information, please read the [FAQ](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java/wiki/FAQ).

# Build Instructions

The org.json package can be built from the command line, Maven, and Gradle. The unit tests can be executed from Maven, Gradle, or individually in an IDE e.g. Eclipse.
 
**Building from the command line**

*Build the class files from the package root directory src/main/java*
```shell
javac org/json/*.java
```

*Create the jar file in the current directory*
```shell
jar cf json-java.jar org/json/*.class
```

*Compile a program that uses the jar (see example code below)*
```shell
javac -cp .;json-java.jar Test.java (Windows)
javac -cp .:json-java.jar Test.java (Unix Systems)
```

*Test file contents*

```java
import org.json.JSONObject;
public class Test {
    public static void main(String args[]){
       JSONObject jo = new JSONObject("{ \"abc\" : \"def\" }");
       System.out.println(jo);
    }
}
```

*Execute the Test file*
```shell 
java -cp .;json-java.jar Test (Windows)
java -cp .:json-java.jar Test (Unix Systems)
```

*Expected output*
